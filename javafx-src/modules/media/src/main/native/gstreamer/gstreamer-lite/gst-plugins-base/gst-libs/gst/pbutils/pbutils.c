 *
 * <refsect2>
 * <para>
 * libgstpbutils is a general utility library for plugins and applications,
 * available since gst-plugins-base 0.10.12. It currently provides the
 * following:
 * </para>
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>
 * human-readable description strings of codecs, elements, sources, decoders,
 * encoders, or sinks from decoder/encoder caps, element names, or protocol
 * names.
 * </para>
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>
 * support for applications to initiate installation of missing plugins (if
 * this is supported by the distribution or operating system used)
 * </para>
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>
 * API for GStreamer elements to create missing-plugin messages in order to
 * communicate to the application that a certain type of plugin is missing
 * (decoder, encoder, URI protocol source, URI protocol sink, named element)
 * </para>
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>
 * API for applications to recognise and handle missing-plugin messages
 * </para>
 * </listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 * <title>Linking to this library</title>
 * <para>
 * You should obtain the required CFLAGS and LIBS using pkg-config on the
 * gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10 module. You will then also need to add
 * '-lgstpbutils-0.10' manually to your LIBS line.
 * </para>
 * <title>Library initialisation</title>
 * <para>
 * Before using any of its functions, applications and plugins must call
 * gst_pb_utils_init() to initialise the library.
 * </para>
 * </refsect2>
