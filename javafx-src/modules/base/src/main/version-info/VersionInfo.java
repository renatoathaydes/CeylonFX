/**
 * The VersionInfo class contains strings that describe the implementation
 * and specification version of the javafx pacakges.  These strings
 * are made available as properties obtained from the System Properties class.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class serves 3 purposes:
 *
 * 1. It creates the JavaFX version properties to be added into the Java 
 * System Properties at the loading of the JavaFX Toolkit. The JavaFX properties
 * are javafx.version and javafx.runtime.version. Their formats follow the 
 * specification of java.version and java.runtime.version respectively.
 * See http://java.sun.com/j2se/versioning_naming.html for details.
 * 
 * For example, a beta release build of JavaFX 2.0 build number 26 will contain 
 * the following properties:
 * 
 * javafx.version = 2.0.0-beta
 * javafx.runtime.version = 2.0.0-beta-b26
 * 
 * 2. It provides methods to access Hudson build information and timestamp.
 * These methods can be used to uniquely identify a particular build
 * for internal test and deployment:
 *
 * The method getHudsonJobName() will returns the name of the hudson job.
 * For example, a master build will have the name as "presidio", and a
 * graphics-scrum will have the name as "presidio-graphics" and so for.
 * An empty string is returned if the build isn't build on Hudson, such as a
 * local build on a developer machine.
 *
 * The method getHudsonBuildNumber() will returns the number of the hudson job
 * on a particular build scrum. The job number is sequentially incremented for
 * each build job.
 * For example, a master build job number of 25 was built before master job
 * number 26.
 * A string of zeros is returned if the build isn't build on Hudson, such as a
 * local build on a developer machine.
 *
 * The method getBuildTimestamp() will returns the timestamp of the build.
 *
 * 3. To uniquely identify a build that isn't generated on Hudson, such as a
 * local build on a developer machine. It substitutes the build number tag of
 * the javafx.runtime.version string with the build timestamp.
 * For example, a beta build of JavaFx 2.0 on a developer machine will look
 * something like the following:
 *
 * javafx.version = 2.0.0-beta
 * javafx.runtime.version = 2.0.0-beta (2011/04/28 22:08:04)
 *
 * 
 * <p>
 * The tags of the form @STRING@ are populated by ant when the project is built
 *
 * @see System#getProperties
