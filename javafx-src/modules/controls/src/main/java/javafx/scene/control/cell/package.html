    <p>The <code>javafx.scene.control.cell</code> package is where all cell-related
    classes are located, other than the core classes such as 
    {@link javafx.scene.control.Cell Cell}, {@link javafx.scene.control.IndexedCell IndexedCell},
    {@link javafx.scene.control.ListCell ListCell}, {@link javafx.scene.control.TreeCell TreeCell},
    and {@link javafx.scene.control.TableCell TableCell}. At present this package
    is relatively bare, but it is where future cell-related classes will be located.</p>
    
    <p>It is important to note that whilst most cells in this package are editable,
        for a cells editing functionality to be enabled it is required that all
        related classes have editing enabled. For example, in a TableView, both
        the TableView and the relevant TableColumn must have setEditing(true) called.
