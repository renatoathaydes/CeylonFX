# This file contains non-translatable properties. These may be
# properties that depend on the country of the locale, rather than on
# the language.
#
# There are no locale-specific versions of this file included with
# JavaFX, but they may be added to the classpath by developers or
# users.  For example, a file named
# com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/resources/controls-nt_ru_RU.properties
# could contain the line "DatePicker.showWeekNumbers=RU" to enable ISO
# week numbers in the Russia locale.

# See Javadoc for java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundle() for a complete
# description of the search and instantiation strategy.
