/**
 * An abstract class that contains the basic functionalities required by all
 * {@code Transition} based animations, such as {@link PathTransition} and
 * {@link RotateTransition}.
 * <p>
 * This class offers a simple framework to define animation. It provides all the
 * basic functionality defined in {@link Animation}. {@code Transition} requires
 * the implementation of a method {@link #interpolate(double)} which is the
 * called in each frame, while the {@code Transition} is running.
 * <p>
 * In addition an extending class needs to set the duration of a single cycle
 * with {@link Animation#setCycleDuration(javafx.util.Duration)}. This duration
 * is usually set by the user via a duration property (as in
 * {@link FadeTransition#duration}) for example. But it can also be calculated
 * by the extending class as is done in {@link ParallelTransition} and
 * {@link FadeTransition}.
 * <p>
 * Below is a simple example. It creates a small animation that updates the
 * {@code text} property of a {@link javafx.scene.text.Text} node. It starts
 * with an empty {@code String} and adds gradually letter by letter until the
 * full {@code String} was set when the animation finishes.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 
 * final String content = "Lorem ipsum";
 * final Text text = new Text(10, 20, "");
 * 
 * final Animation animation = new Transition() {
 *     {
 *         setCycleDuration(Duration.millis(2000));
 *     }
 * 
 *     protected void interpolate(double frac) {
 *         final int length = content.length();
 *         final int n = Math.round(length * (float) frac);
 *         text.setText(content.substring(0, n));
 *     }
 * 
 * };
 * 
 * animation.play();
 * }</pre>
