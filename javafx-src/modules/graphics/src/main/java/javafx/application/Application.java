/**
 * Application class from which JavaFX applications extend.
 *
 * <p><b>Life-cycle</b></p>
 * <p>
 * The entry point for JavaFX applications is the Application class. The
 * JavaFX runtime does the following, in order, whenever an application is
 * launched:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Constructs an instance of the specified Application class</li>
 * <li>Calls the {@link #init} method</li>
 * <li>Calls the {@link #start} method</li>
 * <li>Waits for the application to finish, which happens when either of
 * the following occur:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the application calls {@link Platform#exit}</li>
 * <li>the last window has been closed and the {@code implicitExit}
 * attribute on {@code Platform} is true</li>
 * </ul></li>
 * <li>Calls the {@link #stop} method</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Note that the {@code start} method is abstract and must be overridden.
 * The {@code init} and {@code stop} methods have concrete implementations
 * that do nothing.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Parameters</b></p>
 * <p>
 * Application parameters are available by calling the {@link #getParameters}
 * method from the {@link #init} method, or any time after the {@code init}
 * method has been called.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Threading</b></p>
 * <p>
 * JavaFX creates an application thread for running the application start
 * method, processing input events, and running animation timelines. Creation
 * of JavaFX {@link Scene} and {@link Stage} objects as well as modification of
 * scene graph operations to <em>live</em> objects (those objects already
 * attached to a scene) must be done on the JavaFX application thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Java launcher loads and initializes the specified Application class
 * on the JavaFX Application Thread. If there is no main method in the
 * Application class, or if the main method calls Application.launch(), then
 * an instance of the Application is then constructed on the JavaFX Application
 * Thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code init} method is called on the launcher thread, not on the
 * JavaFX Application Thread.
 * This means that an application must not construct a {@link Scene}
 * or a {@link Stage} in the {@code init} method.
 * An application may construct other JavaFX objects in the {@code init}
 * method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All the unhandled exceptions on the JavaFX application thread that occur during
 * event dispatching, running animation timelines, or any other code, are forwarded
 * to the thread's {@link java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler uncaught
 * exception handler}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <p>The following example will illustrate a simple JavaFX application.</p>
 * <pre><code>
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Group;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.shape.Circle;

        Group root = new Group(circ);
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 400, 300);

        stage.setTitle("My JavaFX Application");
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }
}
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>The above example will produce the following:</p>
