/**
 * A {@code Group} node contains an ObservableList of children that
 * are rendered in order whenever this node is rendered.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Group} will take on the collective bounds of its children and is
 * not directly resizable.
 * <p>
 * Any transform, effect, or state applied to a {@code Group} will be applied
 * to all children of that group.  Such transforms and effects will NOT be included
 * in this Group's layout bounds, however if transforms and effects are set
 * directly on children of this Group, those will be included in this Group's layout bounds.
 * <p>
 * By default, a {@code Group} will "auto-size" its managed resizable
 * children to their preferred sizes during the layout pass to ensure that Regions
 * and Controls are sized properly as their state changes.  If an application
 * needs to disable this auto-sizing behavior, then it should set {@link #autoSizeChildren}
 * to {@code false} and understand that if the preferred size of the children
 * change, they will not automatically resize (so buyer beware!).
 *
 * <p>Group Example:</p>
