/**
 * Specifies a Swing-coordinates camera, suitable for mixing with Swing and
 * the 2D scene graph. The coordinate system defined by this camera has its
 * origin in the upper left corner of the panel with the Y-axis pointing
 * down and the Z axis pointing away from the viewer (into the screen). The
 * units are in pixel coordinates at the projection plane (Z=0),
 * regardless of the size of the panel.
 * The viewing transform is defined by specifying the zero point, the viewing
 * direction, and the up vector.
 * This resulting transform is used as the view portion of the ModelView matrix.
 * The projection transform a fixed perspective transform. The 3D viewport is
 * set to the bounds of the panel.
