     * @defgroup CompositingRules Compositing rules supported by PISCES 
     * When drawing two objects to one pixel area, there are several possibilities
     * how composite color is made of source and destination contributions.
     * Objects can overlap pixel fully and/or partialy. One object could be above
     * the second one and they both can be partialy or fully transparent (alpha).  
     * The way, we count composite color and alpha from theirs contributions is
     * called compositing rule (Porter-Duff).
     * @def COMPOSITE_CLEAR
     * @ingroup CompositingRules 
     * Compositing rule COMPOSITE_CLEAR. This rule applied to destination pixel sets 
     * its color to 0x00000000 - transparent black - regardless to source color.
     * @see setCompositeRule(int), setComposite(int, float) 
     * @def COMPOSITE_SRC
     * @ingroup CompositingRules  
     * Compositing rule COMPOSITE_SRC. This rule applied to destination pixel sets 
     * its color to source color - regardless to previous color of destination 
     * pixel.
     * @see setCompositeRule(int), setComposite(int, float)  
     * @def COMPOSITE_SRC_OVER
     * @ingroup CompositingRules 
     * Compositing rule COMPOSITE_SRC_OVER. This rule is kind of intuitive. When we
     * look through transparent green glass bottle at some object, we can see 
     * mixture of glass and objects colors. Composite color is alpha-weigth average 
     * of source and destination.
     * @see setCompositeRule(int), PiscesRenderer.setComposite(int, float)
