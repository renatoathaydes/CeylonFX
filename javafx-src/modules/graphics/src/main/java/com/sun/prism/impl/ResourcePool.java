/**
 * An interface for tracking the usage of a particular resource from which
 * managed resources are allocated.
 * A given resource pool may share its underlying space with another
 * resource pool, such as the case of allocating textures from the Java
 * heap.
 * In the case of a shared resource, the {@link used()} and {@link max()}
 * methods will return absolute values indicating the amounts used or
 * available for all resources that come from the shared pool, but the
 * {@link managed()} method will only indicate the amount of the resource
 * used for managed resources and the {@link target()} method will return
 * the amount of the total shared resource that the allocation methods
 * should attempt to stay under.
 * <pre>
 *     long newsize = ...; // size of new resource allocation
 *     if (pool.used() + newsize >= pool.target()) {
 *         cleanup(pool);
 *         // possibly multiple passes of increasing aggressiveness
 *     }
 *     if (pool.used() + newsize >= pool.max()) {
 *         throw OOM();
 *     }
 *     allocate(newsize);
 * </pre>
 * The amounts and sizes returned from the methods should all be in the
 * same units, usually bytes.
