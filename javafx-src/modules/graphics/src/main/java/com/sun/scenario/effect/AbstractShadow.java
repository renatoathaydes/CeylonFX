/**
 * An implementation supertype for both Gaussian and Box filter based
 * shadows to facilitate their conditional usage inside the various
 * composite shadow effects like DropShadow and InnerShadow.
 *
 * The radius, width and height parameters all refer to the corresponding
 * dimension that a "Gaussian" blur filter would use - other shadow
 * implementations will have to use whatever parameters produce a
 * similar effect.
 * The width and height parameters should relate to the radius parameter
 * by the equation {@code w,h = 2 * r + 1} and if the width and height are
 * set to something different then the radius parameter will be an average
 * of the corresponding individual dimensional radius values.
