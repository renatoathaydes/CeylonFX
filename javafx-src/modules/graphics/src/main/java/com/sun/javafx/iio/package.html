Provides image loading capability for Java FX.

<p>A plugin for loading a given format is added by creating an
<code>ImageFormatDescription</code> to provide the principal attributes for
recognizing images stored in the format, an <code>ImageLoader</code> which
performs the actual loading of the image data and metadata, and an
<code>ImageLoaderFactory</code> which is able to create an
<code>ImageLoader</code> for a stream of image data stored in the format.
The <code>ImageLoaderFactory</code> is registered with the
<code>ImageStorage</code> object which manages all <code>ImageLoader</code>s
and which also supplies convenience loading methods for application use.
