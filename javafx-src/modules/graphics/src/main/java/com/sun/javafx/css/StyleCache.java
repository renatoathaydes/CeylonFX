/**
 * A cache to store values from lookup.
 * Consider that there are some number of StyleHelpers and that the
 * StyleHelpers are shared. For a particular node, a style might come
 * from its StyleHelper or the StyleHelper of one of its parents (ignoring
 * Node.style for now). What makes a style unique is the set of StyleHelpers
 * that go into its calculation. So, if node N has StyleHelper A and its
 * parents have StyleHelper B and C, the opacity style (say) for N is going
 * to be unique to the set of StyleHelpers [A B C]. Because StyleHelpers
 * are chosen by the rules they match, and because StyleHelpers are shared,
 * every node that has the set of StyleHelpers [A B C] will match the same
 * selector for opacity (for a given pseudoclass state). Further, the value for
 * opacity (in the given pseudoclass state) will not change for the given
 * set of StyleHelpers. Therefore, rather than trying to cache a calculated
 * value with an individual StyleHelper, the value can be cached with a key
 * that uniquely identifies the set [A B C]. Subsequent lookups for the
 * property do not need to be recalculated even if there are lookups in the
 * value. Incidentally, resolved references will also be unique to a set of
 * StyleHelpers and would only need to be resolved once (for a given
 * pseudoclass state).
 *
 * Node.style puts a slight wrinkle in that the style might come from the
 * Node rather than the cache. This can be handled in a relatively
 * straight-forward manner. If Node.style is not empty or null and it
 * contains the property, then that style should be used if the style
 * compares less than the style that would have been applied. If there is
 * some parent with Node.style that would affect the child Node's style,
 * then the cached value can be used.
 *
 * The key is comprised of this helper's key, plus the
 * keys of all this node's parents' helpers.
 *
 * The values in the cache styles that apply are determined
 * by the node's state and the state of its parents. This unique combination
 * of states reflects the state of the node and its parents at the time the
 * style was first determined. Provided the node and its parents are in the
 * same state, then the styles applied will be the same as what is in the
 * cache.
 *
 * The value could be a Map, but there should not be a large number of
 * entries. Computing the key from the long[], doing the lookup and
 * resolving collisions is probably just as bad, if not worse, than
 * finding the matching set of states by comparing the long[].
 *
 * Since all StyleHelpers are relevant to a Scene, valueCache is
 * created by StyleManager.StylesheetContainer and is passed in.
 * Note that all StyleHelper instances within a given Scene all 
 * share the same valueCache!
