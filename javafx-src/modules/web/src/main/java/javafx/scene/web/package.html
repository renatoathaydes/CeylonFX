<p>This package provides means for loading and displaying Web content. Its
    functionality is implemented by two core classes:

<p>{@link javafx.scene.web.WebEngine} is a non-visual component capable of
    loading Web pages, creating DOM objects for them, and running scripts
    inside pages.

<p>{@link javafx.scene.web.WebView} is a {@link javafx.scene.Node} that
    presents a Web page managed by a {@code WebEngine}. Each {@code WebView}
    has a {@code WebEngine} associated with it. This association is
    established at the time {@code WebView} is instantiated, and cannot be
    changed later.

<p>Both {@code WebEngine} and {@code WebView} should be created and
    manipulated on FX User thread.

<p>The code snippet below shows a typical usage scenario:

<ul><code><pre>
WebView webView = new WebView();
WebEngine webEngine = webView.getEngine();
webEngine.load("http://javafx.com");
// add webView to the scene
</pre></code></ul>

</body>
